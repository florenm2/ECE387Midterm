For my midterm project I ordered a pair of of glasses that have a panel of LEDS across the front in place of lenses. These glasses come with two controller boards. One is preprogrammed and cycles through a few basic light patterns on the LED panel, and the other is not programmed and is the "hackable" LED board that allows for customization because it has several i/0 ports. I also ordered an audio sensor for arduino and will program the LED display to respond to audio input, such as music, and display patterns in response to the input. I will use the board that is not preprogrammed to do this.
